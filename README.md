# SPACE INVADERS
## DESCRIPTION <br>

Space Invaders is a two-dimensional game that a player controls a ship that has a cannon to shoot alien ships by moving the ship left to right or vice versa at the bottom of the screen. Alien ships are also move horizontally across the screen as they approach to bottom of the screen.<br><br>
The main objective of the game is defeat all the alien ships by shooting them with your controlled ship. The player earns point as they defeat the alien ships and their movement speed and shooting speed increase as the number of the alien ships get destroyed. <br><br>
After defeating the aliens, new and more difficult to beat wave of aliens have been brought which is a loop that never ends in the game. <br><br>
When the player finish a wave, extra life point has been added. When the enemy ships reach the bottom of the screen or the player loses all the extra life, the game will be over. <br><br>
There are also various bunkers that protect the player from the aliensâ€™ attack, but it can be destroyed after getting too much hit from both player and alien ships.
Further features might be added during the development stage.<br><br>
